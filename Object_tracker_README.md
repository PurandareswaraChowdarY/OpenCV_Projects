# Video Object Tracker with Scene Change Detection

This Python script lets you track objects in video footage using OpenCVâ€™s tracking algorithms. 
It also detects scene changes using SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) to automatically reset tracking when the scene cuts.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Multiple tracking algorithms to choose from, each suited to different scenarios:
  - **BOOSTING:** Basic AdaBoost-based tracker; slower and less accurate, but good for learning.
  - **MIL:** Improved robustness over BOOSTING; better with appearance changes.
  - **KCF:** Fast and accurate, suitable for moderate object motion.
  - **TLD:** Combines tracking and detection; recovers from failures but may give false positives.
  - **MEDIANFLOW:** Precise with slow, predictable motion; struggles with fast moves.
  - **MOSSE:** Extremely fast and lightweight; great for real-time use on low-end hardware.
  - **CSRT:** Most accurate and robust; handles scale and rotation changes well but slower.

- Detects scene cuts by comparing consecutive frames, so the tracker can reset when the video content changes abruptly.
- Real-time FPS display for performance monitoring.
- Works with both video files and live webcam input.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`opencv-contrib-python`)
- scikit-image
- NumPy

Install dependencies via:

```bash
pip install opencv-contrib-python scikit-image numpy
