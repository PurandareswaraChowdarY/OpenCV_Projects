# Line Detection App

A simple GUI tool for detecting straight lines in images using the Hough Transform technique implemented via OpenCV. 
This is a very basic model intended primarily for experimenting with line detection parameters and visualizing how lines are detected in images. 
It is not designed for production or real-world applications but is great for learning and playing around with computer vision concepts.

## Features

- Select an image file to process.
- Adjust Canny edge detection thresholds to fine-tune edge extraction.
- Adjust Hough transform threshold to control sensitivity of line detection.
- Display the original image with detected lines overlaid in red.

## How to Use the Line Detection App

1. Run the script:  
   ```bash
   python your_line_detection_script.py
